- Bootstrap
- React Router Dom
- State Management ->  React Context API +React Redux
- React Toastify

- Github
- https://mockaroo.com To create mock API

### `Performance Improvements`
Pagination:
 - Reduces rendering time by limiting the data shown per page.Improves initial page load speed by fetching smaller chunks of data.

Debouncing:
 - Prevents excessive function calls (e.g., API calls, computations).Delays function execution until user stops input or interaction.
 - Memoization (useCallback,useMemo): 
 - Prevents unnecessary re-creations of functions and expensive operations,prevents the execution of function multiple times.Reduces rendering time by memoizing callback functions and 
 - memoizing the result of functions, improving component performance.

React.lazy:
- React.lazy allows you to dynamically import a component only when itâ€™s required. This is useful for code splitting. When you call lazy(), React will load the component only when the -- route is visited, instead of loading everything upfront.
- React Memo,React fragments

Reusable components(Button,Form,Spinner,Header,Subheader,Usertable,NotFound,Something went wrong,No search results)

- Reusable Hooks(useForm,usePagination)
- Reusable Functions(formValidation,apiHelper,loginValidation,localstorage actions)

- ErrorBoundary(To capture error and displays Something went wrong)

- NotFound(404 When user tries to hit the wrong route)
